# cubit_counter

Counter in Flutter using the Bloc library.
- BlocObserver, which will help us observe all state changes in the application.
- BlocProvider, Flutter widget which provides a bloc to its children.
- BlocBuilder, Flutter widget that handles building the widget in response to new states.
- Using Cubit instead of Bloc.
- Adding events with context.read.âš¡
</br>

### The application uses a feature-driven directory structure. This project structure enables us to scale the project by having self-contained features.

## BLOC Vs CUBIT

- Cubit is a subset of Bloc; so, it reduces complexity.
- Cubit eliminates the event classes.
- Cubit uses emit rather than yield to emit state.
